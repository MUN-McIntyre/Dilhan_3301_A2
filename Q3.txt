Usin a 3x3 average filter on two pics with the same start histogram 
can change their histograms. This is because the averaging process moves 
pixel values around, making similar pixels even more alike, and 
creating a more balanced distribution of values. 
This leads to altered histograms due to the smoothing, 
equalization, and normalization effects of the filter.
